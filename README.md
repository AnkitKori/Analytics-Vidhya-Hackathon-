- Using this model, BigMart will try to understand the properties of products and outlets which play a key role in increasing sales.

Algorithms used:
- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Decision tree Regressor
- Random Forest Regressor
- XGboost (XGB Regressor)

Hyperparameter Optimizer:
- RandomSearchCV (used for best parameters)
- TPOT Regressor
